# Bulldozer workout notes
These are my weights and reps on a six day, 3 way split, alternating with rest days bulldozer workout.

Not much use to anyone but myself, nor of much interest I imagine.

## What is the Bulldozer workout?

It's a workout that aims to complete the total repititions for a workout, over either 4 or 5 sets, with extremely limited recovery between sets. Thirty seconds is the default, though this can be extended to forty-five seconds. The muscle is progressively exhausted, (hopefully) recruiting more muscle fibres than would otherwise be recruited.
An example on bench might be a weight of 60kg. First set, you can do 9 repititions. Your second set, thirty seconds later, you only do 7 repititions. Third, 6 repititions. Fourth, 6 repititions. The total repititions completed is therefore, 9+7+6+6=28. The target for raising weight is 30 repititions. Better luck next time.
Other rules include:
  Don't drop weight in the middle of the workout. Accept your score.
  Stop BEFORE failure or your form becomes sloppy.
